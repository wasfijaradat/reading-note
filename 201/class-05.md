# Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)

## Rule:
***for any CSS styling property intended to be added, the issue is not in finding the most fitting styling feature as it is directing or addressing the intended element to be styled so, divs, classes and ids can do a great job to make it much easire for the website architecht to address the right place to add the style decoration needed.***

### To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>` element. 
from local source as follows:
`<img src="pic_name_.jpg" alt="description">`
from imge address as follows:
`<img src="url" alt="description">`
to insert and resize the imge in HTML syntax: 
`<img src="img.jpg" alt="description" style="width:500px;height:600px;">`
images can be added in the html in the following three possible places:
- before a paragraph
- inside the start of paragraph
- in the middle of the paragraph
